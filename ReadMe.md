The last save of this resource pack was 2020_11_16. Back then, I was not really much of a programmer, and I enjoyed playing Minecraft SkyWars and making this resource pack.

Now, I'm returning to Minecraft because I accidentally dropped all fun/silly activities out of my life, and I need at least one of such. I remember completely remaking the enchantment table in Photoshop, talking to my gf about it, having fun, and realizing how cool it turned out.

## Plan

So, hopefully, this resource pack is going to get much more design consistency, or more useful stuff, or more visually appealing stuff.

Also, I might be able to find the origins of some of the stuff that's in here. Well, VanillaTweaks is obvious, and they leave some info in their files, I like that. But some images were definitely not made by me, and I did not leave any credit in the files because I never thought I'd publish all this.
